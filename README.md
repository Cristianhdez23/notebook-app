# Notebook App

For this project I decided to use [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) version 18.2.0 with Typescript. A Component architecture and for styling, CSS Modules with Sass.

## Offline Mode

- User inputs will persist in the browser thanks to the ```LocalStorage API``` provided by the browser.
- The Project can be run as a Progressive Web Apps(PWA). Offline mode is supported.

In ```Frequency and Similar Words``` section, we can check the frequency of a request word in our entry. Also Similar words will be displayed on screen.
